# DG_Coupler
<p>Couple G502A DG to an autopilot.</p>
<p>If the MIT License does not make it clear, the user bears *all* responsibility to test and validate this circuit.  I cannot control what components are used, how the device is fabricated, what ESD protections are used during construction, and how/if a burn in test is done.  Therefore it is not represented as being useful for anything other than the user's edification.</p>

<p>This technology was mature when Apollo was still a thing.  That in mind it is still reliable but due to all the solid state gyro replacements most owners will be throwing these boat anchors away.  Saves weight and long term cost.</p>
<p>This circuit is intended to work with the Navaid ap-1 similar to the Porcine DG Coupler.  The Porcine unit is no longer available and uses a different DG.</p>

<p>The DG Coupler uses a 3 position SPST switch to select from 3 different Nav sources.  One throw will select the DG input as well as close a relay that changes the autopilot head sensitivy to the L/R signals.  The other two positions select the steering outputs and flag from the Smart Coupler II LE.  Note that the signals polarity and Reference match the output of the Smart Coupler.</p>
