<p>If the MIT License does not make it clear, the user bears *all* responsibility to test and validate this circuit.  I cannot control what components are used, how the device is fabricated, what ESD protections are used during construction, and how/if a burn in test is done.  Therefore it is not represented as being useful for anything other than the user's edification.</p>
